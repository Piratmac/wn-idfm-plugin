# IDFM
The purpose of this [WinterCMS](http://wintercms.com) plugin is to display a simple page with the next visits to your favorite transportation stops in France's Paris region. The data is taken from the platform IDFM (Ile-de-France Mobilit√©s).

## This is BETA software
This plugin is under development. There are a lot of glitches, elements I wish to add or improvements to be made.

I'm not a professional developer. This plugin is one of my first published work. Which means it's certainly full of issues, inconsistencies or unrespected conventions.

It is primarily meant for my personal usage (both as a tool and as a learning experience.) Since it may be useful for other people, I decided to publish it.

Which means:
* You use this at your own risk
* Any feedback is appreciated!
* I do know I'm bad at this, so feedback is really appreciated

## Notes
You'll need an API key, which you can get by registering on [IDFM's platform](http://api-lab-trone-stif.opendata.stif.info/)
